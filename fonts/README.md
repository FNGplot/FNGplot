**DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FONT EXPERT NOR A LAWYER. I try very hard to abide by the rules, make sure all the information I provide is correct, and that everything is legal. However, if things turned out to not be the case, please contact me right away and I'll see how I could fix it.**

To provide ample options for users and a consistent GUI across all devices,
FNGplot carries its own font library and therefore does not depend on the host
OS's fonts.

All of these fonts are licensed under the SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE(OFL) or 
some other license that also permits distribution in my case.(ex: New Computer Modern).
You can check all the licenses in the "licenses" folder.

Except for several fonts listed below, all other fonts are downloaded directly 
from Google Fonts and coverted to WOFF2 files using this tool: 
https: /  / cloudconvert.com / ttf-to-woff2. 

Exceptions:
- New Computer Modern: Downloaded from here: https: /  / fontesk.com / new-computer-modern-typeface / 
- STIX Two Text / Math: Downloaded the WOFF2 version directly from their GitHub repository.

Version: v2.13 b171 (Newest version at my time of download)
- Material Symbols Rounded: Downloaded the TTF version directly from their GitHub repository.
