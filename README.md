## Target User

- Math teachers (K-12 + Freshman year)
- Physics teachers (K-12 + Freshman year)

## Features

`The list will be gradually filled in the near future`

### General

- Geometry
- Algebra
- Conic sections
- Basic calculus
- Basic differential equations
- Basic vector fields
- $\LaTeX$ support

### Special

FNGplot also include many fetaures that are not present in other math softwares, for they are way too specific and would be meaningless in most cases.

Most of these features come in handy when one needs to quickly construct a diagram from a given STEM problem statement.

- Multiple methods to declare basic shapes
  - line:
    - point-point form
    - point-point form w/ extension (used to create beautiful tangents to other shapes)
    - point-slope form
  - circle:
    - center & radius
    - 3-point circle

## Developer team
- Main developer: Wei-Hsu Lin(林韋旭) 
- UX tester: Mu-En Chiu (邱沐恩)

## Note
FNGplot is tested on **Chromium 111.0.5513.0**

Support for other browsers is unnecssary as the final software will be based on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).
