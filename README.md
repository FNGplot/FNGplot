## Target User

- Math teachers (K-12 + Freshman year)
- Physics teachers (K-12 + Freshman year)

## Features

`The list will be gradually filled in the near future`

### General

- Geometry
- Algebra
- Conic sections
- Basic calculus
- Basic differential equations
- Basic vector fields
- $\LaTeX$ support

### Special

FNGplot also include many fetaures that are not present in other math softwares, for they are way too specific and would be meaningless in most cases.

Most of these features come in handy when one needs to quickly construct a diagram from a given problem statement.

- Multiple methods to declare basic shapes
  - line:
    - point-point form
    - point-point form w/ extension (used to create tangents to other shapes)
    - point-slope form
  - circle:
    - center & radius
    - 3-point circle
